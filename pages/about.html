            Hi, my name is <b>Brooke</b> :) along with studying computer science at UCSC, I
            hold a strong and dear passion for guitar and music. I have both played and engulfed
            myself in the world of guitar for over 8 years now. Having been a teacher as well as a learner
            (being self taught myself) I've frustratingly experienced a chronic lack of comprehensive, 
            accessible, and non-gimmicky ways of tracking learning progression, as well as centralizing
            foundational and commonly utilized features for learning and maintaining guitar skill ...

            <span class="title">About GuitarBase</span><br>
            When it comes to tracking progress and learning songs, I've resorted to using spreedsheets
            and note taking apps for years; link after link of websites with specific, singular tools; 
            yearning for a centralized place - designed specifically for guitar - that could aid me in 
            staying organized and inspired as I continue to learn. This is what I set out to remedy with 
            <b>GuitarBase</b>.

            <span class="title">The Goal</span><br>
            This project is very much still in it's early stages, however I plan on building ontop 
            of this project throughout the next couple of years as I deepen my full stack development skills, 
            as I can then implement much more intricate and larger features. My personal goal would be to 
            develop GuitarBase to the level that I would be able to rely on it fully, not needing to
            supplement my learning with any other platform or website.
